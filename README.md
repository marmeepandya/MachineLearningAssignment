# Machine Learning Assignments

This repository contains the assignments for the **IE675b: Machine Learning** course at the University of Mannheim. The course focuses on core machine learning concepts, algorithms, and their practical implementation in Python, with a strong emphasis on model training, evaluation, and analysis.

Each assignment is organized into its own folder, containing code, reports, and visualizations to help understand the various techniques and models applied.

## ðŸ§­ Assignments Overview

### 1st Assignment: Naive Bayes Classifier
In this assignment, we implemented a Naive Bayes classifier with a focus on classification using the MNIST dataset. Key components include:

- Training the Naive Bayes model using a Dirichlet prior with MAP estimation.  
- Evaluating the model's accuracy and analyzing performance using a confusion matrix.  
- Conducting experiments with model selection, data generation, and handling missing data.  

**Instructor Remark:**  
- Task 1: GOOD  
- Task 2: GOOD  
- Task 3: PASS (classification report quoted but not present in report)  
- Task 4: Nicely compact. Function of alpha as prior missing in discussion.  
- Task 5: GOOD (a) GOOD, (b) GOOD: some factual errors  
- Task 6: GOOD  
- **Overall Comment:** look out for typos next time!  
- **Final Grade:** EXCELLENT

### 2nd Assignment: Logistic Regression
This assignment involves logistic regression, using both MLE and MAP estimation techniques on the Spambase dataset. Highlights include:

- Training logistic regression models with different regularization settings.  
- Exploring the effects of regularization on feature importance and model interpretability.  
- Comparing gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent approaches for optimization.
